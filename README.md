![Cover](/assets/smartmockups_k7swvgu2.jpg)

In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

## Why this Project

This project gives you an opportunity to improve an app’s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

## What Will I Learn?

You will learn the role of Gradle in building Android Apps and how to use
Gradle to manage apps of increasing complexity. You'll learn to:

* Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
* Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
* Separate an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively use transitions and motion.

## How Will I Complete this Project?

You will improve an app for this project:

* XYZ Reader: A mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and headlines. **[Download the code here](https://github.com/udacity/xyz-reader-starter-code)**.

The app is currently functional, and work in most cases for most users.

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.

### Supporting Courses

You should have the skills you need to complete this app after completing:

* **[Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853ar)**.
* **[Advanced Android App Development](https://eu.udacity.com/course/advanced-android-app-development--ud855)**.
* **[Material Design for Android Developers](https://eu.udacity.com/course/material-design-for-android-developers--ud862)**.

You can also refer to the **[Material Design specification](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)**.

### Required Tasks
* Download a zip file of the app.
* Read the **UI Review** in the next node.
* Spend time exploring the current state of the app, looking for ways it could be improved. The app will need multiple improvements. Be sure to look specifically at issues called out in the UI Review.
* Execute the improvements!

## UI Review

“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”

“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”
